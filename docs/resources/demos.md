# Spore Demos

Spore Demos are web application demos that can be run in a browser environment.

The demos are more complete projects than the [Spore Examples](./examples.md), developers can study from the demos to understand how fully functional web applications are developed. 
For example, how to connect wallets like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) or [JoyID](https://joy.id).

### A simple `Next.js` demo

A Spore Protocol Demo based on Next.js + React + Spore SDK, which implements basic functionalities, such as the creation and transfer of clusters, as well as minting, transferring, and melting of spores. 

The demo also shows how to connect with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) and [JoyID](https://joy.id) wallets.
